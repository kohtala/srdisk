This program modifies HIMEM.SYS versions 3.09 and later XMS handle table
to contain free memory up to the Kbytes given as parameter. This program
is useful for example if HIMEM.SYS can not determine the amount of
extended memory beyond 64M.

Notice that some versions of MEM only report up to 65535 Kbytes of free
XMS memory even if there is more. You do not need this program if MEM
still reports 65535 Kbytes free XMS after you have allocated some (for
example to SRDISK XMS disk or SMARDRV cache).

Also, newer HIMEM.SYS might have an option for this same purpose. If one
is available, use it instead of this program.

This program is freeware. Copyright (C) 1996 Marko Kohtala. THERE IS NO
GUARANTEES WHATSOVER THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY. IT
MAY DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA, COMPUTER HARDWARE AND YOUR LIFE DISPITE MY
BEST ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE IT DOES NOT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. TEST IT WITH
EQUIPMENT AND DATA YOU ARE PREPARED TO LOSE.

To use this program from CONFIG.SYS, you can say one of:

        DEVICE=XMSSIZE.EXE <Kbytes>
or
        INSTALL=XMSSIZE.EXE <Kbytes>

The difference is the time when this program is run. INSTALL installs
programs after all device drivers are installed. Therefore you have to
use the DEVICE= if your device driver wants to allocate XMS.

You can also have line "XMSSIZE <Kbytes>" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Whichever way you do it, XMSSIZE does _not_ stay resident consuming your
memory. The only difference is the time the program is run.

<Kbytes> is the amount of memory that you have, not the amount of XMS
memory that you want to have. XMSSIZE modifies the last free block of
memory to end at that address.
