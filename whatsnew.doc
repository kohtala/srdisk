2.09 2005-06-05

- Release under GNU GPL license. Source code at http://sf.net/projects/srdisk

- Fix EMS error handling to show the EMS error code.

- Add instructions for Windows 95 users.

2.08 1996-07-15

- Allow clusters up to 32K.

- Allow specifying disk size in megabytes by appending a `M' after the
  size. Like "SRDISK 3M" for a three megabyte disk.

- Option /BOOTSECTOR:file for a boot sector of your own choise.

- Write better boot sector when the sector is big enough.

2.07 1996-03-14

- /VERBOSE:0 added to not even print the banner.

- Minor changes to the output.

- Fixed a bug with over 64M support. At least with some HIMEM.SYS
SRDISK.EXE could not allocate over 64M of memory. That did not matter
much, as HIMEM.SYS seems unable to detect that much of it. There is a
XMSSIZE.EXE (see XMSSIZE.DOC) to force HIMEM to know the real amount of
memory. Be careful with it, you can hurt yourself.

- Midrange BBS has left us.

- Windows 95 users might want to try renaming SRD?MS.SYS to
RAMDRIVE.SYS. I got reports that Windows 95 is faster that way.


2.06 1995-08-09

Sorry for the long delay in upgrades.

- MS-DOS DISKCOPY crashes if the number of sectors on the disk is not a
multiple of the number of sectors on a track. SRDISK does not always use
the last sectors on a disk, but now it includes them in the sector
count. This helps make the number of sectors as DISKCOPY wants it.

- PTSDOS (a Russian DOS clone) does not support 128 byte sectors. The
device drivers now say when they are loaded that they have 512 byte
sectors so that PTSDOS accepts them. While resizing the disk, user must
still give /S:512 option to SRDISK as I do not know how to detect the
PTSDOS and force the sector size automaticly.

- Accept newest versions of DOS.

- Updated information on Software News, Midrange BBS, mailing list, echo
conference, Airline BBS, license fees, upgrade disks, SWIFT.


2.05 1994-01-31

- Most of SRDISK registrations have been coming from Germany. Now SRDISK
has an authorized vendor for SRDISK users in Germany, Austria and all
neighbouring countries with German language. Software News is the vendor
for Swiss users. See DEUTSCH.DOC for details.

- New option /REMOVABLE:OFF that allows making the disk appear not
removable. This is just to help fool some ill behaved programs.
Something not to be used unless you really have to.

- MS-DOS InterSvr could not access SRDISK drive. There is a slight bug
in InterSvr which revealed a slight bug in SRDISK. SRDISK fixed so the
InterSvr bug does not cause trouble.

- SRDISK now assumes less what happened when an allocation failed. This
results in tidier behaviour in error situation with some memory
managers.

- SRDUMMY.SYS fixed to report error if DOS does not tell the driver the
letter where it is about to be installed by DOS.

There are still problems with Stacker 3.1 (at least). Seems Stacker
makes DOS report wrong drive letters to block devices like SRDISK loaded
after it.


2.04 1993-05-19

I must address my sincere thanks to Bruce, Jeremy and Theo for reporting
the problems they were having. I do not have the resources to test every
feature for every release and therefore there can be some bugs which I
can not spot without your help. Again, thanks.

- Partial rewrite on the internal logic by which SRDISK.EXE works. Some
small details changed for better.

- Serious bugs fixed in calculating the format for over 32M disks.

- Resizing had some overflow errors for over 65535 sector disks (usually
over 32M disks) resulting in damaged disk contents.

- Serious bugs in device drivers especially when appending to another
driver fixed.

- Updated XMS interface to use XMS 3.0 32-bit functions when necessary.
Thus you can allocate over 64M disks using XMS (provided you have that
much memory and your memory manager supports it).

- Improved DOS 3.2 compatibility. Now SRDISK finds it's drive letter
correctly and /E switch works for first COMMAND.COM too.

- Improved /MAXSIZE and /FREE:n options' operation for XMS memory. They
now often result in larger disks and become not smaller than necessary.

- Added /F:2880 for 2.88M disk image emulation.

- /M option now works again for multiple devices.

- Added SUOMI.DOC for Finnish users.

- Removed some empty lines from output.


2.03 1993-04-22

This is not as big upgrade as I thought I make it. The reason is that
the new features I have been planning would be best added by rewriting
somewhat large portions of the software and it takes time. This upgrade
adds a few of the most requested features and addresses some problems in
MS-Windows.

- ReSizeable RAMDisk now has a support BBS in the United States of
America, Illinois, Palatino:

  The Midrange System BBS
  Sysop: David Gibbs
  FidoNet: 1:115/439
  Phones: 708-776-1062 and 708-776-1063, both have HST and V.32
  Using Remote Access

Latest SRDISK is available via file request using magic file name
SRDISK.

- Options /MAXSIZE and /FREEMEM:n to determine disk size so that no or
specified amount of memory left free.

- Added device driver SRDUMMY.SYS to use up drive letters. You can give
it as a parameter the drive letter the next drive should be loaded at.
This was requested by some users so that they can reserve drive letters
for network, CD-ROMs and keep the RAM drive at a fixed drive letter.
Some after bootup device driver loaders are more memory efficient fix
for this problem though.

- Added device driver SRDEMS3.SYS. This uses only EMS 3.2 calls and is
good to avoid MS-Windows 3.1 bugs in EMS emulation. There still is no
way you can resize disk inside Windows. If you do that, the memory is
freed by Windows when you exit the DOS session.



2.02 1993-01-27

- Fixed a problem with /ENV switch. It had a loose pointer that could
mess up with some parameters or cause a null pointer assignment message.

- Installed code for registration reminder and registration keys. The
reminder is not big, but I guess registered users do not want to see it.



2.01 1993-01-08

- Option /AVAILABLE:n added to resize the disk to the size when it has
n Kbytes space available.

- Option /MINSIZE added to resize the disk to the smallest size
possible or disable it if there is no data on it. This is the same as
/AVAILABLE:0

- Option /FILESPACE:n added to resize the disk to the size when it has
n Kbytes space for files.

- Added some ERRORLEVEL returns. SRDISK.EXE should now returns nonzero
ERRORLEVEL, if there were problems with the format (errors, failure,
would destroy contents, but not allowed to).

- Aborted formatting could enable the disk although no memory was
allocated for it. Error handling fixed.

- Setting environment variables did not work with DOS prior to version
3.30. Changed environment variable setting so that it does not try to
find the command processor, but just modifies the parent's environment.
Also it is better made sure that the parent is real.

- Device drivers did not detect read/write errors. Now it is detected
that MS-Windows Enhanced mode does not emulate EMS 4.0 correctly and
causes errors.

- Disabled possibility to allocate disk while in MS-Windows Enhanced
mode. Windows frees the memory allocated by the program when the DOS
window is closed, so the disk memory would be lost then.

- A number of other bugs removed and features cleaned.



2.00 1992-12-12

- Memory allocation bug that gave XMS error A7 removed.

- Disk resizing could change the reported size of clusters at some rare
cases although the cluster size was not changed.

- Now asks if disk contents are to be removed if all the old data can
not fit the new disk being created.



2.00 BETA 3 1992-11-06 A pre-release version for the version 2.0

- Made two versions of the device drivers: full featured and small.

- Full featured device drivers now have their own stack so that user
need not care of it. Small device drivers do not have this.

- Optimized some code for faster operation.

- Fixed a problem with root directory sectors being cleared with resize.

- DR-DOS problems solved. The device driver did not preserve flags and
this seemed to have caused the trouble with DR-DOS.

- Now should correctly estimate the available memory size before trying
to format. Still possible to fail with XMS though - this is due to the
incomplete services of XMS.

- Memory allocation while preserving disk contents fixed.



2.00 BETA 2 A pre-release version for the version 2.0

- Memory allocation while preserving disk contents fixed.

- Changed the multiplex number back to what it was in 1.x versions. BETA
1 had a different number so that it will not conflict with existing 1.x
version disk.

- Boot sector is now updated correctly when disk is resized. Thus you
can diskcopy a disk into RAM disk, resize it and diskcopy it to a disk
of another format - great for boot disks too!



2.00 BETA 1 A pre-release version for the version 2.0

- SRDISK now tries to preserve the disk contents by default.

- Device driver SRDEMS.SYS for EMS memory support. Requires EMS version
4.0.

- Device drivers are now compatible with DOS DISKCOPY command. Use
SRDISK /F switch to configure SRDISK to the same format as the floppy
and you can then diskcopy between the floppy and RAM Disk. Great for
disk duplication - no need to swap the disks any more. Also DISKCOPY
to/from the floppy is much faster than copying each file one by one.

- Alternative command line options and some new options. The longer
options can be shortened if they remain unambiguous.

- /U (or /UNCONDITIONAL or /ERASE) switch can be used to clear the disk.

- /F (or /DOSFORMAT) has many FDFORMAT disk sizes and formats added. The
available sizes are listed in SRDISK.DOC.

- New options are added to better support different floppy formats:

	/MEDIA:n		- Defines the media ID byte
	/HEADS:n or /SIDES:n	- Defines sides on the disk
	/SECTORS:n or /SPT:n	- Defines sectors per track
	/DEVICETYPE:n		- Device type (0=360K floppy, 1=1.2M floppy,
				  2=720K floppy, 3=8-inch single density,
				  4=8-inch double density, 5=hard disk,
				  7=1.44M floppy, 9=2.99M floppy)

- Error condition handling for batch operation enhanced.

	/ASK			- Ask about destroying data (default)
	/YES or /FORCE		- Destroy data if necessary to complete
	/NO			- Do not destroy data


1.42

- Restricted FAT copies to maximum of 2. DOS 5 did not manage well if
there were more.

- SRDISK.SYS caused the block devices loaded after is to have bad drive
letters assigned to them.

- Tried to read root directory when there was no disk.

- MS-DOS 5 does not interpret the disk size correctly after it has had
to face a bad disk. Deviced a get-around for the bug.

- Memory allocation has been fixed to help the memory managers.

- Made stack larger.



1.41 1992-06-06

- I started to take a licensing fee from corporate users. Sorry, I have
no other income currently. I tried to make the prices reasonable, but if
you feel the prices are too high for your casual use, you can try to
bargain.

- One '!' had disappeared from the env.c causing the /E not to work.
Hopefully not many copies of the 1.40 version got out.

1.40 1992-06-03

- DR-DOS 6 hangup solved by passing a valid looking BIOS Parameter Block
  at init.

- Added a check for DR-DOS 5, since SRDISK did not seem to work with it
  unless sector size was 128 bytes. Under DR-DOS 5 sector size now
  forced to 128 bytes.

- resolve_drive() now finds drive letters even if driver loaded high
  with some upper memory manager utility. Also if driver not found,
  disks should be configurable anyway as 1:, 2:, etc. - although better
  would be to tell the drive letter in CONFIG.SYS.

- Disk size 1 with /F:1 to get rid of drive not ready reports.

- Unless forced sector/cluster/root dir sizes, adjust them properly.

- Have srdisk handle allocation of known types of memory. Also enhanced
  allocation to hopefully work better with DesqView.

- Reorganized source to several files. Also many other minor changes and
  source beautifying.

- Multiplex interrupt interface changed a bit.

- Borland C++ 3.0 produced bad code handling long integers and thus the
  beginning of FAT was a little wrong. Changed the code to one not
  having a bug.



1.30 1992-01-18

- Changed to freeware from public domain

- Changed the driver control from IOCTL calls to multiplex interrupt.

- Added support for over 32M RAM drives (up to 4096M). Over 32M drives
  need DOS 4+ because they use over 0xFFFF sectors.

- Added /V switch for program verbosity control. /Y now only forces the
  disk format, it does not make the program less verbose.

- Support for chained drivers. These drivers all contribute memory for
  the same virtual drive. Added switch /M to control how much memory may
  be used by each driver in the chain.

- Formatting reads the root directory to find out if there is anything
  that would be destroyed. If not, it will not ask for permission to
  destroy.

- Added /E switch to set environment variables SRDISKn to show srdisk
  drives.

- Scans Drive Parameter Table on DOS 2 and 3 to find the drive letters,
  if necessary.



1.20 1991-10-04

- Fixed name of program by adding the missing 'Re' to 'Sizeable'.

- Added 16 bit FAT support; more 'sizeable' disks that had over 4077
  clusters were not operational. Due to DOS's inconsistent behaviour,
  disks with over 4077 and under 4088 clusters (or over 65518, possible
  with 128 byte clusters and 8M disk size) are avoided by making
  clusters bigger.

- Added DOS lookalike disk formats via switch /F.

- The FAT number is now defined via switch /A instead of /F.

- The time of format is stored in volume label.

- Upgraded to IOCTL_msg version 1.20 which tells the type of memory used
  by the driver.

- Disallow sectors greater than 512 bytes as DOS can not handle them
  properly but rather crashes when it encounters them.

- Allow clusters up to 8 kilobytes.

- Enhanced help.



1.10 1991-09-06

- Added full support for multiple FATs. 1.00 had the /F switch, but no
  support for it in formatter.

- Updated to IOCTL_msg versio 1.10 so that media byte is no longer used
  to indicate the media change but to indicate the drive is RAM disk.

- Some minor fixes.



1.00 1991-06-09 Initial release
