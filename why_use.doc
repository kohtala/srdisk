                 ReSizeable RAMDisk - Reasons to use it


Here are some cases when you could use SRDISK

- You have a bootable diskette that you should copy to a different sized 
diskette. With SRDISK you can DISKCOPY it to the RAMdisk, resize the 
RAMdisk and DISKCOPY it to the other diskette.

- You have some programs that need free EMS or XMS memory and others 
could use it better as a RAM disk.
